OSC To Spout
============

![The very simple OSC To Spout window](doc/osctospout.png)

This is a very tiny tool to map OSC ([Open Sound Control](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control)) messages to a GPU texture and share them with [Spout](http://spout.zeal.co/). This might sound totally useless but is actually the most efficient way I found to get OSC messages into [KodeLife](https://hexler.net/products/kodelife), and I needed this to feed beat data from [Cooldown](https://github.com/eliemichel/Cooldown) when doing some live-coding of visuals. Kodelife can read the Spout-shared texture using its Shared-image feature:

**NB** This is a Windows-specific tool, since Spout is a Windows-specific library. For OSX, you can consider using Syphon.

Building
--------

This is a regular [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) project, so you need to install OpenFrameworks, then run the [projectGenerator](https://openframeworks.cc/learning/01_basics/how_to_add_addon_to_project/) to configure the solution with your installation of OpenFramworks.

You need the addons ofxOsc (built-in) and [ofxSpout](https://github.com/elliotwoods/ofxSpout).

Customizing
-----------

This tool was made for my specific need, and everybody uses different OSC messages addresses, so you will need to customize them. Go to `src/ofAp.cpp` and tweak the `Settings` section to fit you needs, in particular change the `addr_to_index` dictionnary to map your OSC messages to the lines of the texture.

Limitations
-----------

The texture values are clamped within the range 0-1. This is very annoying to me, so if you find a work-around, please share it!
